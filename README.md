> A four-junction traffic network modeled using conservation laws, linear algebra, and discrete-time state-space analysis — with eigenvalue-based stability verification.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project models steady-state and dynamic traffic flow across a four-junction road network. It covers:

- ✔ Conservation of vehicles at each junction
- ✔ Linear algebraic formulation (`AX = B`)
- ✔ Behavioral turning ratio constraint to resolve rank deficiency
- ✔ Discrete-time state-space modeling for dynamic adaptation
- ✔ Eigenvalue-based stability analysis (spectral radius criterion)

## 🗺️ Network Layout

The network consists of four junctions (A, B, C, D) with internal flows `x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄` and fixed external inflows/outflows at each node.

```
        [A] ──x₁──▶ [B]
         ▲              │
         x₄            x₂
         │              ▼
        [D] ◀──x₃── [C]
```

## 📘 Part I — Static Traffic Flow Model

### Governing Principle

At steady state: **Flow In = Flow Out** at every junction.

| Node | Equation              |
|------|-----------------------|
| A    | x₁ + x₄ = 475        |
| B    | x₁ + x₂ = 655        |
| C    | x₂ + x₃ = 1050       |
| D    | x₃ + x₄ = 870        |

### Matrix Formulation
The system is written in compact form:

AX = B

Where

A =
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

B =
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
475 \\
655 \\
1050 \\
870
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Since `rank(A) = 3 < 4`, the system is rank deficient and has infinitely many solutions without an additional constraint.

### Turning Ratio Constraint

At node A, drivers split according to:

x₁ / x₄ = 3 / 2

This behavioral constraint closes the system and yields a unique solution.

### ✅ Static Solution

| Flow | Value (veh/hr) |
|------|----------------|
| x₁   | 285            |
| x₂   | 370            |
| x₃   | 680            |
| x₄   | 190            |

- ✔ Non-negative flows
- ✔ Satisfies all conservation equations
- ✔ Unique feasible solution

## 📘 Part II — Dynamic Traffic Flow Model

The static model assumes instantaneous equilibrium. To model gradual driver adaptation, a discrete-time state-space system is used.

### Dynamic Equation

The system evolves as:

X(k+1) = [(1 − α)I + αP] X(k) + αU

Where:

- α ∈ (0,1) is the relaxation parameter  
- P is the routing matrix  
- U is the external inflow vector  

---

### Model Parameters

**Relaxation parameter:** `α = 0.4`

**Routing matrix:**
\[
P =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0.3 & 0 & 0.35 & 0 \\
0 & 0.7 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0.65 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

External inflow:

\[
U =
\begin{bmatrix}
285 \\
0 \\
0 \\
190
\end{bmatrix}
\]


### ✅ Dynamic Steady-State Solution

| Flow | Value (veh/hr) |
|------|----------------|
| x₁   | 285.00         |
| x₂   | 161.13         |
| x₃   | 112.79         |
| x₄   | 263.31         |

### 📊 Stability Analysis

| Eigenvalue | Value |
|------------|-------|
| λ₁         | 0.600 |
| λ₂         | 0.600 |
| λ₃         | 0.874 |
| λ₄         | 0.326 |

Spectral radius:

ρ(A_d) = 0.874 < 1

Since all eigenvalues satisfy |λᵢ| < 1:

✔ The system is asymptotically stable  
✔ Disturbances decay over time  
✔ The network converges to equilibrium for any initial condition

## 📈 Convergence Simulation

The simulation initializes flows at zero and iterates the state-space equation until convergence. All four flows smoothly reach their steady-state values within ~30 time steps.

## ▶️ How to Run

Clone the repository and run each script in MATLAB:

```matlab
% Step 1 — Solve static model
static_model

% Step 2 — Solve dynamic model and compute eigenvalues
dynamic_model

% Step 3 — Simulate and plot convergence

## 🧠 Key Insights

**Static Model**
- The node-balance system is rank deficient; a turning ratio constraint is required to obtain a unique solution.
- The constraint encodes driver behavior and is physically motivated.

**Dynamic Model**
- Captures the gradual redistribution of traffic as drivers adapt over time.
- The relaxation parameter `α` controls convergence speed — larger `α` means faster but potentially less stable adaptation.
- The spectral radius `ρ(Aᵈ) < 1` guarantees asymptotic stability for all `α ∈ (0, 1)` with this routing matrix.

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Capacity-constrained optimization (link flow upper bounds)
- Nonlinear congestion modeling (e.g., BPR function)
- Sensitivity analysis of `α` on convergence rate
- Continuous-time formulation via ODEs
- Validation against real-world traffic count data
